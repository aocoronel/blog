## $ whoami

I'm quite a minimalist person, who loves to try digital tools, that are simple, and make some myself.

I take programming as a hobby, and mostly of my handcraft goes towards terminal applications.

By the way, I wouldn't have the eager to make anything about tech, if I didn't use Linux (I use Arch, by the way). The reason is simple: you have control and freedom to do anything.

Beyond that, I'm currently a Veterinary Medicine undergraduate, who has a very long journey along the way.

## The Blog

This website is born from the will to make things, you will probably find a bit of everything, but the main topics I talk about are related to Information Technology (IT) and Veterinary Medicine.

Note that any of my post aren't an ultimate source of truth. I'll try to bring other sources to reinforce my point of view, when possible. For subjetive posts, I'll make it clear that it is subjective, thus do not take it too serious.

The currently tool I use to create my blog is [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) with the [Radion Theme](https://github.com/micahkepe/radion) with my own CSS changes to fit my [Elegant Vagrant Theme](https://github.com/aocoronel/elegantvagrant).

It wasn't always like this. First I used to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [Chirpy Theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy). It was good, but I wanted to make something very personal and unique to me. Once I found out an interesting repository that shows how to create a webpage from markdown files at [montioo/pandoc-md2html-example](https://github.com/montioo/pandoc-md2html-example). In short, it uses a tool called `pandoc` to make conversions from markdown to HTML. That's the starting point from this blog design. That blog design was totally made by me.

That repository is rather raw in customization and features, so many of the implementations that you can see in my blog were made by me such as: Category selection, sidebar, the index page (like a feed for all posts), all the color choice, I've modified the post layout and I also made huge improvements to the core mechanism to generate the website itself, by adding several new variables, changes to the template itself, automatic structuring of different categories, which can be noted by an "Older" and "Newer" section at the end of each posts, similarly to Chirpy's Theme

For historical purposes, you can find two prints from my original blog I baked [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aocoronel/aocoronel.github.io/refs/heads/blog/content/blog/assets/legacy-index.avif) and [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aocoronel/aocoronel.github.io/refs/heads/blog/content/blog/assets/legacy-nixos-review.avif).

## Philosophies

I believe that the most simple things, the simplest projects and the tiny tools are the most efficient. It’s strange how the technology evolved to a bloated ecosystem whenever you look. That’s why I embrace the command line! Despise its simplicity of handling only text, it holds an immense power and infinite extensibility.

The minimalism is something I find out to be the way. It just feels right anywhere you apply it, but nothing too extreme. But, of course, there is no right way of doing anything.

I praise many extensible tools, because they are not complete. By that, I mean there is no museum to walk through. You build your own museum by extending them to fit your needs. In other words, it's an incentive to creation. If it was all about consuming, you wouldn't be reading this right now. I would be surely be too busy reading someone's else content instead.

I'm not shackled by social media, doom scrolling or by algorithm suggestions, but not immune. I simply consume what I intend to. I'm free from the very known villain called smartphone. It's my tool, and not the opposite.

I believe knowledge should be accessible for all. That's why this blog will never serve contents behind a paywall.

## My Work

Currently building simple scripts that solves common problems, without the extra bloat.

## My Goal

My goal is to show how the tiny things are worth more.

## AI

Some elements from this blog were made with assistance of AI, like JavaScript for the sidebar, a python script to generate feeds from the index page and some help with Github Actions to deploy this blog.

I cannot tell I did not use AI, and I cannot say I don't use.

Having that said, the contents from my posts are never going to be AI generated, this includes all text and images (except for the logo).
